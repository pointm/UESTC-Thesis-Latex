We observe tuning of the window response as the circular waveguide length is changed. High-power testing is performed at 2.5 W, 100\% duty at 218 GHz.},

  abstract  = {RF window maintains vacuum sealing as well as it provided maximum RF power transmission with minimum reflections at/in a desired frequency/frequency regime (passband). Passband tailoring is needed to suffice the operation of multi-frequency vacuum electron devices (VEDs). To accommodate the multiple frequencies broadening and tuning of the passband is investigated. Broadband RF window cannot pass the RF power, which is developed and propagated at the different distant frequency for multi-frequency gyrotron. A quad frequency RF window is designed for multi-frequency operation of gyrotron. A diamond window provides the accurate formation of passbands with negligible reflectivity (in order of 10-4) at desired frequencies.},

  abstract = {A broadband dielectric window with high power handling capability for gyrotron traveling wave tubes (gyro-TWTs) had been designed based on the step-type impedance transition structure. The manufactured beryllium oxide (BeO) window can achieve a relative bandwidth of 35.3\% with a maximum reflection of −20 dB in the X -band, and the corresponding transmission loss is over −0.1 dB. The resonant spikes caused by engineering factors, including assembly tilt and gap, are investigated and analyzed. Thermal analysis shows that the BeO window can achieve a high average/CW power handling capability of over 232 kW within a wide frequency range. The fabricated input window has been successfully applied in our X -band broadband and high-power gyro-TWT.},

  abstract = {The concept of compact waveguide window based on the low-loss cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) is proposed in this letter, which considers the characteristics of broadband performance, transparency, sufficient mechanical strength, and simple mechanical process, by simply integrating the machined bipyramids-type COC dielectrics into the modified waveguide. To verify our idea, two waveguide windows consisting of internal dielectrics and external fixtures are designed and fabricated. The two types of waveguide windows are measured along with two strain rectangular waveguides at the Ka-band with the return loss better than 18.5 dB over the related frequency range of 42.8\% and better than 20 dB over the related frequency range of 49\%, respectively. The measured results show the advantages of the proposed concept, which is an excellent candidate for broadband application at a millimeter-wave frequency or higher.},
